1. go to root (cd /root/ ) . (both Master and Worker can perform this in their instances)

2. git clone https://github.com/ashishrpandey/example-voting-app

3. go to /root/example-voting-app/k8s-specifications

4. [root@ip-172-31-7-102 k8s-specifications]# kubectl apply -f .

5. for voting and result pods, Observe that NodePort is assigned.

6. take your publicIP (your instance IP) : NodePort â–º open 2 browsers , one for VOTING and one for Results.

7 try voting and see the results paralelly in results page.



8. Now try to delete the Pods one by one (first voting Pod, then worker pod, then db pod) and see what happens to the voting and result app after deleting.



9 Write your observations in a text file.

10. what happens after db pod deletion. 

11. complete the assignment by making the result pod work. (if you delete db pod, results would not be captured.So repeat what we did in the class in order to make the result pod work.).

12. Write in the text file, what you did in order to make the result pod work.

All the Commands are bellow

1. Commands that you used during the assignment.

2. snapshot of logs (wherever possible)


3. your comment on WHY result app STOPPED working after db pod stop
--- Both the application pod used a socket connetion toward Db if socket break app restart.
After deleting DB port we can see there are no votes the entire data get erased.

4. your answer to HOW YOU MADE THE RESULT POD work. 
---After delation of the DB pod we lost the entire vote result , but DB pod will come up automatically and once DB pod is up you will get your appliction worked.

5. Some jargons (just names are enough- dont need sentences) that you learnt from the 40-hour Training session
